# Enrichment Analysis Notebooks 
Enrichment Analysis Use Cases. Tools to analyse plant biology knowledge graphs and find enriched traits or bioprocesses in differential gene expression data. The project uses data from Knetminer, ENSEMBL, EBI Gene Expression Atlas and others, exported as Knowledge graphs using Agrischemas/Bioschemas annotations. 

# Running the notebooks using Binder
For running the jupyter notebook for Enrichment Analysis using KnetMiner SPARQL endpoint,<br>click on launch binder:
